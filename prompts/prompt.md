TOPIC NAME: [Specific chapter name from GCDMP document]

I'm preparing for the Certified Clinical Data Manager (CCDM) exam and want to practice with targeted questions for the chapter on [TOPIC NAME]. Please create a set of questions that:

1. Cover the key concepts within this topic area
2. Follow industry standards and best practices (GCDMP, CDISC, ICH-GCP, 21 CFR Part 11, etc.)
3. Reflect the type of application-based and analytical thinking required by the CCDM exam
4. Address different aspects and subtopics within [TOPIC NAME]

Create [COUNT] [DIFFICULTY] questions about [TOPIC NAME] in Clinical Data Management:

For each question:
1. Include 4 answer options (A, B, C, D) with only one correct answer
2. Provide the correct answer with a stepwise explanation that references industry standards, regulations, or best practices
3. Label each question with its difficulty level and a specific subtopic for better categorization
4. Ensure the questions test both factual knowledge and application/reasoning skills
5. Make the incorrect options plausible (not obviously wrong)

Please format the output as a YAML file I can import into a flashcard program, using this structure:
```yaml
- question: "What is the primary purpose of [specific process] in clinical data management?"
  difficulty: "easy" # easy, moderate, challenging
  options:
    a: "Option A"
    b: "Option B"
    c: "Option C"
    d: "Option D"
