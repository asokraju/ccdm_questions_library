COUNT: 20

DOMAIN:
    Industry/Practice (real-world application of principles)
    Theory (conceptual understanding of principles and regulations)

TOPIC NAME: [Specific chapter name from GCDMP document]

I'm preparing for the Certified Clinical Data Manager (CCDM) exam and want to practice with targeted questions for the chapter on [TOPIC NAME]. Please create a set of questions that:

1. Cover the key concepts within this topic area
2. Follow industry standards and best practices (GCDMP, CDISC, ICH-GCP, 21 CFR Part 11, etc.)
3. Reflect the type of application-based and analytical thinking required by the CCDM exam
4. Address different aspects and subtopics within [TOPIC NAME]

Create [COUNT] [DIFFICULTY] questions about [TOPIC NAME] in Clinical Data Management:

For each question:
1. Include 4 answer options (A, B, C, D) with only one correct answer
2. Provide the correct answer with a stepwise explanation that references industry standards, regulations, or best practices
3. Label each question with its difficulty level and a specific subtopic for better categorization
4. Ensure the questions test both factual knowledge and application/reasoning skills
5. Make the incorrect options plausible (not obviously wrong)

Please format the output as a YAML file I can import into a flashcard program, using this structure:
```yaml
- question: "What is the primary purpose of [specific process] in clinical data management?"
  difficulty: "easy" # easy, moderate, challenging
  options:
    a: "Option A"
    b: "Option B"
    c: "Option C"
    d: "Option D"
  answer: "a"
  explanation: "Explanation of the correct answer with reference to industry standards or best practices (not specifically referencing the document)."
  subtopic: "specific subtopic within the chapter"

TOPIC NAME: Design and Development of Data Collection Instrumens

I'm preparing for the Certified Clinical Data Manager (CCDM) exam and need practice questions for the chapter on [Topic Name]. I have attached the specific document/chapter content that should be used as the SOURCE for all questions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **CONTENT SPECIFICITY**
   - ALL questions MUST be answerable using ONLY the information in the provided document
   - You may ask questions that require applying concepts from the document to scenarios
   - You may ask questions that require reasonable inferences based on the document's content
   - Do NOT ask questions requiring information not present in the document
   - Do NOT ask about specific numbers, dates, or details unless explicitly stated in the document

2. **SCENARIO COMPLEXITY**
   - EASY questions: Single-concept application scenarios (e.g., "Your team needs to do X. Based on the standard, what should you do?")
   - MODERATE questions: Multi-concept integration scenarios (e.g., "Your study involves X and Y. How do standards A and B work together?")
   - CHALLENGING questions: Complex integration requiring synthesis of multiple concepts (e.g., "Given constraints X, Y, and Z, how would you apply multiple standards to solve this problem?")

3. **INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE LEVEL**
   - Questions should be answerable by someone with 2-5 years of clinical data management experience
   - Assume working knowledge of basic CDM concepts
   - Focus on practical application, not theoretical memorization
   - Include realistic workplace scenarios that CDM professionals actually face

CREATE 90 QUESTIONS TOTAL:
- 30 EASY questions
- 30 MODERATE questions  
- 30 CHALLENGING questions

QUESTION FORMAT:
For each question provide:
1. A realistic workplace scenario or situation
2. Four answer options (A, B, C, D) with only one correct answer
3. The correct answer letter
4. An explanation that references concepts from the provided document
5. Difficulty level (easy/moderate/challenging)
6. Subtopic within the chapter

QUESTION TYPES TO INCLUDE:
- "You are setting up a study that requires..."
- "Your manager asks why..."
- "A stakeholder questions the approach to..."
- "During an audit/inspection..."
- "When implementing [specific process]..."
- "Your team encounters [specific challenge]..."
- "A vendor/CRO proposes..."
- "Regulatory guidance requires..."

AVOID QUESTIONS LIKE:
- "What year was X established?"
- "How many [specific number] are there?"
- "What is the definition of X?" (unless applying it)
- Pure memorization questions
- Questions about details not in the document

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please format as YAML:
```yaml
- question: "[Scenario-based question]"
  difficulty: "[easy/moderate/challenging]"
  options:
    a: "[Option A]"
    b: "[Option B]"
    c: "[Option C]"
    d: "[Option D]"
  answer: "[correct letter]"
  explanation: "[Explanation referencing document concepts]"
  subtopic: "[Specific subtopic]"
```
Dont use words like: `according to the document` in question and answer.
Dont always have b as your correct answer.
