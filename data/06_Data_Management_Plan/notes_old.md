# Comprehensive Clinical Data Management Exam Preparation Notes

## Introduction to Clinical Data Management

Clinical Data Management (CDM) is the process of collecting, cleaning, and managing subject data in compliance with regulatory standards. The primary objective of CDM is to provide high-quality data by minimizing errors and missing data to ensure reliable and statistically sound analysis. CDM serves as the foundation for clinical trials, ensuring data integrity throughout the entire research process.

### Evolution of Clinical Data Management (2013-2025)

The field of clinical data management has undergone significant transformation since 2013:

- **Transition from Paper to Electronic**: Evolution from paper-based systems to fully electronic processes, with EDC now the industry standard
- **Emergence of Clinical Data Science**: Traditional CDM has evolved into a more analytical, integrated approach with emphasis on data science principles
- **Systems Integration**: Movement from siloed data systems toward integrated platforms connecting various data sources
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Shift from experience-based approaches to strategies supported by advanced analytics
- **Regulatory Expansion**: Implementation of ICH E6(R2), ICH E8(R1), and upcoming ICH E6(R3) guidelines emphasizing risk-based approaches

## Part I: The Data Management Plan (DMP)

### Purpose and Importance

A Data Management Plan is a comprehensive document that serves as the core documentation tool within Clinical Data Management for a given study. The Society for Clinical Data Management (SCDM) defines a DMP as:
