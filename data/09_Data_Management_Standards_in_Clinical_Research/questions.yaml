    d: "Regulatory agencies don't check versions"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "Different CDASH versions may have varying mappings to SDTM, requiring careful reconciliation to ensure consistent, compliant submission datasets."

- question: "During due diligence, you find a potential acquisition target uses no data standards. What's the integration cost consideration?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "Standards don't affect acquisition costs"
    b: "Significant cost for retroactive standardization and future integration"
    c: "Their approach might be better"
    d: "Keep their system separate permanently"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "Lack of standards requires costly retroactive standardization for regulatory submissions and prevents portfolio integration, significantly impacting acquisition value."

- question: "A precision medicine trial generates complex genomic data. The team proposes a novel domain structure. What standards-based alternative exists?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "Novel domains are required"
    b: "LAB with pharmacogenomics extension plus appropriate SDTM domains"
    c: "Standards don't cover genomics"
    d: "Use text fields only"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "LAB pharmacogenomics extension handles genomic data transfer, while SDTM domains with appropriate qualifiers capture genomic findings, avoiding custom structures."
  subtopic: "Genomics Standards"

- question: "Your data warehouse team wants to implement a 'universal' model combining all CDISC standards. What's the fundamental issue?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "This is the ideal approach"
    b: "Each standard serves specific purposes in the data lifecycle"
    c: "Technology doesn't support this"
    d: "Regulatory requirement prevents this"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "CDASH, SDTM, and ADaM serve different purposes in the data lifecycle (collection, tabulation, analysis). Combining them loses these distinct functional benefits."
  subtopic: "Standards Architecture"

- question: "A sponsor argues their therapeutic area is too specialized for standard domains. How would you demonstrate SDTM flexibility?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "Agree and create custom standard"
    b: "Show how findings domains, qualifiers, and SUPPQUAL accommodate specialization"
    c: "SDTM is rigid and cannot adapt"
    d: "Wait for therapeutic area standards"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "SDTM's design with findings domains, extensive qualifiers, and SUPPQUAL for additional variables provides flexibility for specialized therapeutic areas within the standard framework."
  subtopic: "SDTM Flexibility"

- question: "During a regulatory submission, FDA questions why your ADaM datasets don't align with SDTM variables. What does this indicate?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "ADaM doesn't need to align with SDTM"
    b: "Broken traceability between tabulation and analysis datasets"
    c: "FDA misunderstands ADaM"
    d: "This is normal"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "ADaM should maintain clear traceability to SDTM. Misalignment indicates broken data lineage, compromising regulatory review and potentially requiring resubmission."

- question: "A medical device company acquiring a pharma company wants to standardize submissions. How do STED and eCTD standards interact?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "They are mutually exclusive"
    b: "STED for devices, eCTD for drugs, both for combination products"
    c: "eCTD replaces STED"
    d: "Create new standard"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "STED handles device-specific requirements while eCTD manages drug submissions. Combination products may require elements of both standards for comprehensive submissions."
  subtopic: "Combination Products"

- question: "Your organization wants to leverage AI for protocol development. How does the PRM standard support this innovation?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "PRM prevents AI use"
    b: "300+ standardized protocol elements enable AI training and automation"
    c: "AI replaces need for standards"
    d: "Protocols can't be standardized"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "PRM's identification of 300+ common protocol elements provides structured data that can train AI systems, enabling intelligent protocol development while maintaining standards."

- question: "A CRO offers a 'CDISC-compliant' service but only implements partial standards. What's the risk for sponsor oversight?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "Partial compliance is sufficient"
    b: "Incomplete implementation risks regulatory issues and integration problems"
    c: "CRO expertise is sufficient"
    d: "Compliance is binary"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "Partial standards implementation creates regulatory risk, complicates data integration, and may require costly remediation. Sponsors must ensure comprehensive compliance."
  subtopic: "Vendor Management"

- question: "Your company runs platform trials with multiple substudies. How should SDTM trial design domains handle this complexity?"
  difficulty: "challenging"
  options:
    a: "Create separate SDTM databases"
    b: "Trial design domains can represent complex multi-arm structures"
    c: "SDTM cannot handle platform trials"
    d: "Use free-text descriptions only"
  answer: "b"
  explanation: "SDTM trial design domains (TA, TE, TV, TI, TS) can represent complex platform trial structures with multiple arms and substudies within a single framework."
