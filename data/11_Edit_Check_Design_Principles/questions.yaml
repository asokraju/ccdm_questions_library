# EASY QUESTIONS (1-30)
- question: "Your team is starting a new oncology study and needs to implement edit checks. The protocol and CRF design are complete. What should be your first step in designing edit checks?"
  difficulty: "easy"
  options:
    a: "Begin programming edit checks for all data fields"
    b: "Review the protocol to identify safety and efficacy parameters"
    c: "Create test data for validation"
    d: "Train data entry staff on edit check procedures"
