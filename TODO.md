## Current Priority: Phase 1 Implementation

The next immediate tasks are:
1. Set up Pydantic AI agents with correct usage patterns
2. Implement the question generation pipeline
3. Establish LLM backend service integration
4. Create core data models and storage layer

## System Architecture Overview

The system leverages existing LLM backend infrastructure:
- **LightRAG API** (localhost:8000) for document processing and knowledge graphs
- **Ollama** (localhost:11434) for LLM inference and embeddings  
- **Qdrant** (localhost:6333) for vector storage and similarity search
- **Redis** (localhost:6379) for caching and task queuing
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring and metrics

Four main pipelines:
1. **Question Generation Pipeline**: Generate new questions from CCDM content
2. **Question Review Pipeline**: Evaluate and improve existing questions  
3. **User Analytics Pipeline**: Analyze performance and provide recommendations
4. **Content Management Pipeline**: Manage question lifecycle and updates

## Notes

- All agents implemented using correct Pydantic AI patterns (output_type, instructions, proper Ollama integration)
- Maintains compatibility with existing quiz app YAML format
- Comprehensive monitoring and quality assurance throughout
- Scalable architecture supporting multiple concurrent users
- Privacy-compliant following GCDMP data protection standards
