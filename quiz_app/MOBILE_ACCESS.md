# 📱 Mobile Network Access Guide

## Quick Start
To access the CCDM Quiz from your mobile device on the same WiFi network:

```bash
# Start the application with network access
./start_network.sh
```

The script will display your network IP address and provide mobile access instructions.

## 🌐 How It Works

### Network Configuration
- **Backend:** Binds to `0.0.0.0:3001` (accepts connections from any IP)
- **Frontend:** Serves on `0.0.0.0:3000` (network accessible)
- **WiFi Compatible:** Works on any local WiFi network

### Access URLs
- **Host Computer:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Mobile Device:** `http://[YOUR_IP]:3000`
  - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Network Mode
```bash
cd quiz_app
chmod +x start_network.sh
./start_network.sh
```

### 2. Get Your Network IP
The startup script automatically detects and displays your IP:
```
🌐 Network Access: http://192.168.1.100:3000
📱 Mobile Access: Use network IP on same WiFi
```

### 3. Connect Mobile Device
1. Ensure mobile device is on **same WiFi network**
2. Open mobile browser
3. Navigate to `http://[DISPLAYED_IP]:3000`
4. Bookmark for easy access

```

Simply visit this URL to generate a QR code, then scan with your mobile device.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect from Mobile?

1. **Check WiFi Network**
   ```bash
   # Verify both devices are on same network
   # Host: Check your WiFi network name
   # Mobile: Ensure connected to same WiFi
   ```

2. **Check Firewall**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/WSL: Allow ports 3000 and 3001
   sudo ufw allow 3000
   sudo ufw allow 3001
   
   # Or temporarily disable firewall for testing
   sudo ufw disable
   ```

3. **Check Router Settings**
   - Some routers block device-to-device communication
   - Look for "AP Isolation" or "Client Isolation" settings
   - Disable these features if enabled

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| IP shows as "localhost" | Check network connection, try different IP detection method |
| Mobile browser can't load | Verify firewall settings, check same WiFi network |
| Slow loading on mobile | Clear browser cache, check WiFi signal strength |
| Touch targets too small | Update CSS, ensure viewport meta tag is correct |

### Manual IP Detection
If automatic detection fails:
```bash
# Linux/WSL
hostname -I
# or
ip route get 8.8.8.8 | grep -oP 'src \K\S+'
# or 
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

## 📊 Network Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **WiFi Network:** Both devices on same network
- **Bandwidth:** Minimal (quiz app is lightweight)
- **Ports:** 3000 (frontend) and 3001 (backend)
- **Browser:** Modern mobile browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

### Supported Networks
- ✅ Home WiFi networks
- ✅ Office WiFi networks
- ✅ Mobile hotspots
- ✅ Public WiFi (if device-to-device communication allowed)

### Network Types That May Not Work
- ❌ Networks with strict AP isolation
- ❌ Enterprise networks with device restrictions
- ❌ Some public WiFi with client isolation
- ❌ VPN connections that route traffic differently

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Local Network Only
- Application only accessible on local network
- No external internet access required
- Data stays within your local network

### Best Practices
- Use on trusted WiFi networks
- Don't expose to public internet without additional security
- Consider firewall rules for production use

## 📱 Mobile Browser Recommendations

### Recommended Browsers
- **iOS:** Safari, Chrome
- **Android:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- **Features:** Modern JavaScript support, touch events

### Browser Settings
- Enable JavaScript
- Allow local network connections
- Clear cache if experiencing issues

## 🚀 Advanced Configuration

### Custom IP Binding
Edit `backend/server.js` to bind to specific IP:
```javascript
app.listen(PORT, '192.168.1.100', () => {
  // Custom IP binding
});
```

### Custom Ports
Edit `package.json` to use different ports:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "PORT=8080 HOST=0.0.0.0 react-scripts start"
  }
}
```

### Nginx Reverse Proxy (Advanced)
For production deployment with custom domain:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.local;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
    
    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
