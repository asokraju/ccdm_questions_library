## Summary
- Fixed difficulty selection showing as plain text instead of interactive UI
- Fixed user progress tracking showing zeros for all users

## Changes Made

### 1. Difficulty Selection UI Fix
- Added missing CSS styles for the difficulty selector in `quiz.css`
- Added CSS import to `QuizConfig.js` component
- Implemented grid layout with hover effects and selected state
- Difficulty options now appear as clickable cards instead of plain text

### 2. User Progress Tracking Fix
- Updated `QuizContainer` to properly save user-specific progress after each answer
- Modified progress updates to include:
  - Overall correct/incorrect counts
  - Topic-specific statistics
  - Subtopic-specific statistics
  - Complete answer history with timestamps
- Fixed reset functionality to work with user-specific data

### 3. Code Improvements
- Added `useEffect` to reload progress when user changes
- Ensured progress syncs properly across devices
- Maintained backward compatibility with global progress

## Test Plan
1. ✅ Click "Start Quiz" - should show configuration page with styled difficulty options
2. ✅ Select difficulty level - options should be clickable with hover effects
3. ✅ Take a quiz as any user (e.g., Vasudha)
4. ✅ Check "Your Progress" - should show actual statistics, not zeros
5. ✅ Reset progress - should clear user-specific data
